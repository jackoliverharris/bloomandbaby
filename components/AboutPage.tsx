              Hello, I&apos;m Sheena - a mum of two young boys and the founder of Bloom & Baby.
            </p>

              After many years living in London, I now call Bath home. Like so many mothers, I found the transition
              into early motherhood far more complex than I expected. It was beautiful and joyful, yes, but also
              overwhelming, isolating, and at times incredibly hard. I experienced postnatal anxiety and often felt as
              though I was constantly trying to keep my head above water.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-[#f1e7da] [text-shadow:0_2px_9px_rgba(0,0,0,0.28)]">
              In the middle of all of that, I discovered something surprisingly powerful: stepping outside, taking a
              breath, and spending time in nature. Gardening became a quiet anchor for me. Working with my hands,
              feeling the soil, and watching things grow helped me slow down and feel grounded again.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-[#f1e7da] [text-shadow:0_2px_9px_rgba(0,0,0,0.28)]">
              Being outdoors had a real impact on my mental wellbeing and gave me moments of calm within the chaos of
              motherhood - moments where I could reconnect with myself, not just my role as a mum.

                  When I looked around Bath for mum-and-baby groups, I noticed that many were focused almost entirely on
                  the baby - often busy, noisy, or centred around milestones and stimulation. What I could not find much
                  of was a space that truly centred mothers&apos; wellbeing (aside from some lovely postnatal yoga classes).
                  Even then, it could be hard to fully focus. Juggling the class while tending to your baby often meant
                  missing out on the experience.
                </p>
                <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-[#f1e7da] [text-shadow:0_2px_9px_rgba(0,0,0,0.28)]">
                  Bloom & Baby was created to fill that gap. I wanted to offer a calm, nature-based mum and baby group in
                  Bath where mothers could slow down, overwhelm could soften, connection could happen naturally, and small,
                  achievable moments could restore confidence.
                </p>
                <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-[#f1e7da] [text-shadow:0_2px_9px_rgba(0,0,0,0.28)]">
                  If your baby needs feeding, settling, or just a cuddle, they will not miss out. Activities are designed
                  to be flexible and can be enjoyed at the mother&apos;s own pace, without a strict routine.

            Bloom & Baby brings together gentle gardening, mindful moments, and baby-friendly nature sensory play in a
            way that supports postnatal wellbeing, reduces isolation, and helps mums feel more grounded and supported
            during early motherhood.
